# Welcome to EventVista!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Our application is designed to streamline the event planning process by providing a platform for event coordinators. Currently, event coordinators manage bookings, client communications, and vendor coordination manually through emails, phone calls, and printed documents, which leads to inefficiencies and missed details. This application will serve as an organizational tool for coordinators to create events, store customer and vendor data, and share event details.
